      "1. Transformers are a type of machine learning model used for natural language processing tasks, such as translating from one language to another or generating text. They were introduced by Google researchers in 2017 and have since become one of the most popular models for NLP tasks due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies in text.\n",

Transformers consist of a series of self-attention layers, which allow each word in the input sequence to attend to every other word in the sequence, weighted by the relevance of each word for understanding the current word's meaning. This allows the model to focus on relevant information and ignore irrelevant details, resulting in more accurate predictions.\n",

Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers do not use recurrence or convolution, making them faster and easier to train on long sequences.
