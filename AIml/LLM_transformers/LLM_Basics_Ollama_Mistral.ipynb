      "2. Transformers consist of a series of self-attention layers, which allow each word in the input sequence to attend to every other word in the sequence, weighted by the relevance of each word for understanding the current word's meaning. This allows the model to focus on relevant information and ignore irrelevant details, resulting in more accurate predictions.\n",

      "3. Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformers do not use recurrence or convolution, making them faster and easier to train on long sequences. Transformers also handle parallelization better than RNNs and CNNs, allowing for more efficient training on large datasets."
